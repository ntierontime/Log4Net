version 3.0
==========================
- added Grid helper

- added textbox helper

- added Client Side API for AjaxList

- removed .SearchButton from AjaxList

- AjaxForm and Confirm helpers have been merged into the Form helper

- optimized html output for AjaxDropdown, AjaxList, Autocomplete

- added XML Documentation


--------------------------
   going from 2.0 to 3.0
--------------------------

to change from AjaxForm to Form you just have to replace Html.Awe().AjaxForm to Hmtl.Awe().Form

==================

Html.Confirm can be replaced with Html.Form

so instead of:

Html.Awe().Confirm().ConfirmClass("myconfirm")

  <form ...>
...
  <input type="submit" value="submit" class="myconfirm"/>
  </form>


you do:

Html.Awe().Form().FormClass("myconfirm").Confirm(true)

(by default the form will be submited via ajax, if you don't need that add .UseAjax(false))

  <form ... class="myconfirm">
...
  <input type="submit" value="submit"/>
  </form>

===================
	
AjaxList's 2.0 .SearchButton(string) was setting the id of a button that will trigger the AjaxList to search, 
with 3.0 you can trigger the search with the client side api by doing $('#ajaxListId').data('api').load();

or you may not need a search button at all, because changing a parent element will trigger search on the ajaxlist, you can disable the automatic triggering of search when changing the value of a parent element by calling .LoadOnParentChange(false)
